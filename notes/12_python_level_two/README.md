**Everything in python is an object. Now let's see how we can make our own objects**<br><br>
![19](screenshots/19.PNG)<br><br>
**Attributes are characteristics of an object. Methods are operations we can perform on an object**<br><br>

**What is the print function actually doing? How can we get it to say something like Title: Python, Author: Jose, etc.**<br><br>
![39](screenshots/39.PNG)<br><br>
**Special methods (methods starting and ending with __) allow us to do this**<br><br>
![40](screenshots/40.PNG)<br><br>

![42](screenshots/42.PNG)<br><br>
**Screenshot above shows that there are many such special methods**<br><br>

![68](screenshots/68.PNG)<br><br>
**s followed by either 1 or more s or 1 or more d**<br><br>
![69](screenshots/69.PNG)<br><br>
**caret symbol excludes the symbols that follow it in the square brackets**<br><br>
![70](screenshots/70.PNG)<br><br>
**sequences of lower case letters**<br><br>
![71](screenshots/71.PNG)<br><br>
**sequences of upper case letters**<br><br>
![72](screenshots/72.PNG)<br><br>
**r is used in from of the regex because r designates a raw string in Python, which has different rules than a standard string, such as you don't have to escape backslashes and other special chars. \d represents a digit**<br><br>
![73](screenshots/73.PNG)<br><br>
**\D gets the non digits**<br><br>
![74](screenshots/74.PNG)<br><br>
**\s gets the white space**<br><br>
![75](screenshots/75.PNG)<br><br>
**\S gets the non white space**<br><br>
![76](screenshots/76.PNG)<br><br>
**\w gets the alphanumeric characters**<br><br>
![77](screenshots/77.PNG)<br><br>
**\W gets the non alphanumeric characters**<br><br>

## Modules and Packages

![81](screenshots/81.PNG)<br><br>
**But dont use import * unless you absolutely have to, because it wastes a lot of memory**<br><br>

## Decorators
![82](screenshots/82.PNG)<br><br>
**locals() returns a dictionary of all the local variables and globals() returns a dictionary of all the global variables. Note that there are a lot of predefined global variables**<br><br>
![83](screenshots/83.PNG)<br><br>

**function as an argument**<br><br>

![91](screenshots/91.PNG)<br><br>
![92](screenshots/92.PNG)<br><br>
![93](screenshots/93.PNG)<br><br>
**1 and 2 does the same thing. adding the @function_name (decorator) before the def makes it so.**<br><br>

## Name and Main
![94](screenshots/94.PNG)<br><br>
![95](screenshots/95.PNG)<br><br>
**OK, so again, as I mentioned, sometimes when you're importing from a module, you would like to know
whether a modules function is being used as an import or if you're using the actual original DCPI file.
So as we saw before, if I'm importing something from two into one and I run the one, that pie script
I want to know, did that function directly come from one or was it imported from two?
And you can determine this by using that if name is equal to main statement and when your script is
run by passing it as a command to the Python interpreter, such as we've done with Python notes that
Stoppie, all of the code that is at the indentation level zero gets executed in functions and classes
that are defined are well defined, but none of their code gets ram.
Unlike other languages, there's no main function that gets run automatically.
The main function is implicitly all the code at the top level.
And in this case, that top level code is that of an F block, and that's the if name is equal to me.
So let's actually show this.**<br><br>
![96](screenshots/96.PNG)<br><br>
![97](screenshots/97.PNG)<br><br>
**And all of this works because of this name, so this __name__
is a built in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.
And thus you can test whether or not your script is being run directly or being imported by something
else.
OK, that's really all we wanted to get across here**<br><br>
