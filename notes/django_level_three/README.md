**And we're also calling the form as underscore P, which uses a paragraph, and that's going to allow
you to have a nicer layout of your actual form, it's going to return it within paragraph tags.
That way they're actually lined up from top to bottom instead of from left to right.
If you just use form by itself inside those two sets of curly brackets, it's going to go from left
to right and you're not going to have a form looking form that means top down instead of that left to
right.
And that gives you a nice format to work with, using those paragraph tags, which are automatically
put there with the ads, underscore P.**<br><br>

## Form Basics
**First, as before, create a project, an app, update the urls.py, settings.py, views.py, create a templates folder, another folder in the templates folder with the app name, inside that folder create index.html and form_page.html. Then continue below**<br><br>

**I hit submit and I'm getting an error.
CSR of F work verification failed request aborted.
So remember, as I mentioned the previous lecture, we need to have that tag there in order to have
the security that we need to make sure our users are safe from submitting their form or submitting data
to some other website.
So.
As I mentioned, a lot of these forms are going to break if you don't have that tag, which is a good
thing, keeps you safe programer.**<br><br>

**So if I hit submit, notice that over here on the bottom, I had a bunch of get calls, but now I get
a post here.
So it's actually accepting the information.**<br><br>
